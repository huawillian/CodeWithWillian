          <h1> About Me </h1>
          <h3> Hi, my name is Willian, and I like to create new things, especially having to do with software and music. After I graduated from TCNJ in May 2015 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, I took a break to work on some side projects. I made this website to showcase the various things I have created. </h3>

        <p class="main-content-p"> To succeed in any endeavor, one must aspire to learn far beyond an action's scope and then dedicate, commit to accomplishing that aspiration. One must have the heart of student and have a life-long commitment to learning. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fbpK5RPCpUg/maxresdefault.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> When I was in college, I aspired to learn a skill set that would allow me to create anything I wanted to create. During my spring and winter breaks, I freqently learned new software development tools. Now, I am able to develop applications on many platforms including Android, iOS, and Web. Also, with various my research experiences, I am able to greatly analyze and dissect any problem while coming up with an applicable well-defined solution. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> However, I was not able to do all these great things alone. I want to take a moment and thank my fellowship at CEMC for their continuing support and also to thank God for blessing me with these great talents. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src="[[importPath]]images/fellowship.jpg">
        <p class="main-content-p"> "The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him." (Psalms 28:7) </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> The Lord gives me strength. The lord knows my weaknesses and helps me overcome them. For as long as I trust in the Lord and have faith in him, I am content. I will continue to praise him and lift up my brothers and sisters in Christ with the musical talents he has given me. I pray for the Lord's guidance and the strength to pursue my career goals.</p>
