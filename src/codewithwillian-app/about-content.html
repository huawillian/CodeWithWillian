      <my-content-section title="Overview" subtitle="Life is about having resilience. Everytime you fall you must have the courage to get back up.">

        <p class="main-content-p"> During college, people often thought of me as one of the most motivated persons around with a clear sense of direction and purpose. I'm always up-to-date with the tech world. I often spend my free time learning new hobbies. My conversations usually revolved around career choices. But, in reality, this was really a shell to keep my mind off of my frustrations. My life was much different before...</p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Simply put, I had depression during high school. My sophomore year, for example, I gained 60 pounds because everyday I would come home from school and eat at least 3 prepackaged, frozen meals, and then play video games. I had bad grades in school. But, worst of all, I had no one I could trust to talk to about my problems. Although I didn't smoke or drink, this behavior really shaped my personality to date.</p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> To overcome this depression, I decided to make myself strong, both physically and mentally. I may give up on the world, but I will never give up on myself. I started learning programming on my own and going to the local gym. I started getting A's again in school. Life from this point became an upwards curve because I learned what it means to have resilience. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://amandacarroll.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/get-back-up.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Throughout college, I actively prepared myself for the future. My vision was on the bigger picture of learning. I loved learning. And so, I with this attitude, I achieved many great things in my career path and personal life.</p>

      <my-content-section title="Lifelong Learning" subtitle="Being a lifelong student means being humble, receptive, and self-reflective">
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://www.pptbackgrounds.org/uploads/hardworking-student-powerpoint-templates.JPG'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Lifelong Learning means being a lifelong student. But what does it mean to be a student? For many people, the idea of being a student stops after college, or high school for others. But if you think about it, these people really don't stop learning after graduating right? </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Being a good student means being humble. But, don't get humbleness mixed up with feeling insignificant or inferior when comparing yourself to another. Humbleness involves being objective and showing respect regardless of one's achievements. While a humble man may be successful, he compares himself to the bigger goal in life and not to another's successes. He praises everyone equally. Being a humble student, one keeps focus on learning and never puts himself above others just because he knows the material better than others.</p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c4/13/97/c413974b325ea7ed93e7503658aee46b.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Being a good student means being receptive. And, being receptive means to be open-minded to another's suggestions and ideas. The greatest contributing factor to someone's downfall is ignorance. For example, the manager who ignores customer feedbacks will go out of business. As a receptive student, one learns the subject well, but does not accept that he completely knows the subject, for another's perspective may provide additional knowledge. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Lastly, being a good student means being self-reflective. When learning something new, the student takes a step back and applies the newly gained knowledge in his or her life. Once applied, that knowledge becomes wisdom.</p>

      <my-content-section title="Personal Growth through Adversity" subtitle="">
        <p class="main-content-p"> I'd be lying if I said deciding my aspirations was easy. Following graduation, I bought many textbooks and took online courses. But it was very hard to stay active. I just kept falling behind, until I became overwhelmed by the sheer amount of knowledge I did not have when compared to other graduate students. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> "I gave up..."</p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src="[[importPath]]images/giveup.jpg">
        <p class="main-content-p"> Feeling a sense of failure, I locked myself up in my room and played video games. I did a few projects here and there, but no longer having that clear goal of becoming a researcher hurt my self-esteem. Throughout college, I always tried to keep strong, telling myself that I am not a failure. And when the time came for me to fail, I was stunned and couldn't get back up. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> A few of my friends came from the nearby church to check on me. I was fine (so I thought). But after a few conversations, I opened up and discovered why I had failed... </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I was often a loner in college, doing things by myself. When I had depression in high school, I lost trust in a lot of people. I never really recovered from that time. When something similar to high school happened during college, I fell down again. I held a grudge that really took over my life. Even after deciding to vent my frustrations by focusing on school, that grudge kept coming back. I decided that at the end of college, I wanted a new start. I wanted to let things begin anew.</p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> I did this... believing that I had the strength to overcome this world by myself. Slowly, but surely, I lost my motivation. My aspirations faded. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> When I returned to Friday fellowship, I was frightened by people asking where I've been and then judging me if I did not come up with a good excuse. But instead, everyone joyfully welcomed me. 'It's nice to have you here again'. Since then, I've made so many bonds, shared so many experiences with the fellowship. I've regained my trust in people from there on. Being with the fellowship has really changed my views on life. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I just want to thank everyone in the fellowship and, most importantly, God for putting these amazing people in my life. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Nowadays, I play piano for Singspiration and Sunday service. I hope to be able to really encourage my brothers and sisters with my songs of praise and testimony because chances are, there will be those that have gone through the same troubles I have overcome. Being accountable to my brothers and sisters is my calling as a growing Christian.  </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> Going with the flow is not how to live life. One must be active and always look for opportunities to improve. There are 3 aspects of my life I wish to improve: Spirit, Mind, Body.</p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Spiritually, I wish to develop a good character and be a good testimony to others because actions are stronger than words. And, good character is the culmination of good actions. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Mentally, I wish to succeed in my career path as a web developer. I also wish to share my knowledge and wisdom with the people in this world and 'Be The Change' I want to see. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Physically, I wish to break the barrier that has confounded me since high school: to become fit once again. That is my only physical goal. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Thanks for reading about me. If you are interested in my career choice, you may visit my developer page. </p>
