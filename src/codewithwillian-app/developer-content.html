      <my-content-section title="Overview" subtitle="There's just too many things to learn. Games development. Web development. Research. I want it all!">
        <p class="main-content-p"> Unlike most Computer Science majors at TCNJ, I didn't take any programming classes during high school. My school didn't offer any classes. Instead, I learned how to program on my own, starting with C++ on linux systems. I actually installed VMware along with a very bare linux distro. My first few projects were arcade games using a 2D game engine. By the time I got to college, I was already well-versed with the programming syntax and logic. </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> The image above is an example of something <b>similar</b> to what I created at the end of high school. The current project folder is long gone. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p">During college, I started learning even more languages, building applications of different kinds. Java, C++, C. But of course, I often needed to learn languages and tools that were not a part of the class itself, going well beyond the scope of the CS program at TCNJ. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Before deciding to become a Software Developer, I was actually leaning closer to Academia and research as my career path. I went to a research program (REU) at Georgia State University (GSU) with a concentration of High Performance Data Mining. There, I eventually published my first research paper on IEEE named, 'Threshold and Associative Based Classification for Social Spam Profile Detection on Twitter'. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> For my capstone, I created a set of programs that helped me transcribe Japanese Drumming (Taiko) arrangements into thier base notation (kuchi shoga). This research paper was published on ICMA named, 'Automatic Transcription of Japanese Taiko Drumming Using the Microsoft Kinect'.</p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Taiwanese_taiko_drummer.jpg/338px-Taiwanese_taiko_drummer.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> You get my point... </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> My last internship during college was at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) International, where I worked on an Augmented Reality Training Renderer. There's way too many things to get into specifics here, so please browse my projects instead. There will be fragments of each piece for this project I worked on. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://static.wixstatic.com/media/997dbb_e806ad2a8a314384b09a93e2aba260b9.png'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Research was fun. You get an objective and you work with other professors to figure out an algorithm to achieve that objective. It required a lot of work and thinking to produce an elegant program. However, as my college career was drawing closer to an end, it was very difficult for me to decide whether I wanted to continue doing research. And so, I took a break to do some of my own research projects focusing on Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Eventually, I got distracted and started working on other projects. Software development projects. I started making games and websites again. After a year, I found my calling. I want to be a web developer. </p>

      <my-content-section title="Game Development" subtitle="I love playing games. But I love making games even more.">
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://www.darkhorrorgames.com/games/images/slenderman-2d-featured.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I've been playing video games all my life. I started with Pokemon on GameBoy, to Final Fantasy X on PS2, to League of Legends on PC. I've pretty much played every genre... EXCEPT Horror. I absolutely cannot play those kinds of games. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> One time, I remember running out of games to play. After a moment of 'sighing', I came up with an idea. Why not make games that I want to play? With some knowledge of game development, I decided to learn Unity, a 3D game engine, and my game development path took off. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://random42.com/sites/default/files/work/casestudies/Random42-Oculus-GearVR-Headset.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Unity is amazing! There's so much potential with this tool. My senior year in college, I made a 2D platformer game called Bakemono Blitz. Post-college, I made a 3D multiplayer zombie survival game using Unity's UNET where you can connect to a game session over the internet. The last game I made was a Virtual Reality game using Google Cardboard called Barnland Security where you grab animals to save them from being beamed away by Aliens! I got a Samsung Gear VR headset some time ago. Maybe i'll make something for that as well. You can actually find my projects on github. Just make sure you download Unity first. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Game development is so fun. But, I honestly cannot see it as a career path. The pay is just too unreliable. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> If you're interested working together on a game, email me. If it doesn't work out, at least I can help you get started. Email: </p>

      <my-content-section title="Mobile Development" subtitle="">
        <p class="main-content-p"> This section will be short as I have little experience with mobile development. For my mobile development class, I worked on two projects with a friend. Unfortunately, we never published these apps to the respective stores. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://www.skywardtechno.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Outsourcing_App_Development_SkywardTechno.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> For iOS, we created an app called Barbuddies where you connect to other phones via bluetooth. During the connection, the app will notify everyone if someone leaves the area and opens a menu where you can call or message that person (assuming the correct information was provided during login).</p>
        <p class="main-content-p">For Android, we created a video game app called Android Claw where you pick up android plushies with a claw. On the way up, there are obstacles that will drop the plushies on collision. Oh, and you control the claw by tilting the device left and right. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://www.virtualrealitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vr-applications.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> My last experience coding for the mobile platform is during my internship at SRI International. The AR Trainer is actually deployed on an Odroid device that is connected to an AR headset. I worked equally on the backend and frontend, so I had to deal with both the Android SDK and platform dependent libraries for both Android and Linux, as well as Unity preprocessing code to make sure the the entire 'system' works fluidly. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Mobile development is nice. But, web development is just more mature . Not to mention, you can make Web Apps that can function as a native mobile app while including plugins to cover additional mobile features that aren't yet supported such as VR, Bluetooth, offline capabilities. </p>

      <my-content-section is-action="true" action-link="/#/browse/projects/" action-name="Browse My Projects" title="Web Development" subtitle="Internet of Things. Games. Mobile. Web Apps. Endless Possibilities">
        <p class="main-content-p"> Although web development is relatively new to me, it strikes me as the platform with the most potential. For example, when a company creates a public service, the company hires a web developer, Android developer, and iOS developer. But what if, the web developer can make apps that work offline in the mobile device? That web developer, or, Web APP developer can take the jobs of both Android and iOS developers, making him or her 3 times as valuable. Think about that for a second. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I started learning web development during my research experience at GSU, so from then, it has been about 3 years. However, I only started taking web development seriously post-graduation. Since then, I have learned so many new frameworks and tools. Front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, MDL, and Polymer Paper Elements. Back-end frameworks such as Parse and Firebase. Project frameworks such as Polymer, Angular 2 (when it was in beta). And developer tools such as NodeJS and bower. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> This website, for example, uses Polymer, Polymer Paper Elements, NodeJS, bower, Firebase, and a few custom polymer elements found on: customelements.io </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Web development is my choice as a career path because it is always growing, always at the forefront of technology, and as endless possibilities. </p>
