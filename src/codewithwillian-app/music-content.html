        <p class="main-content-p"> I play piano for Singspiration and Sunday service at CEMC. However, growing up, I've actually played at least 10 different instruments proficiently. Classically, I've played instruments like piano and violin. For band, I played trumpet. I like these kinds of music a lot more than... say... heavy metal or dubstep because they sound cleaner and more natural.  </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> Recently I've been making more of an attempted to learn how to play contemporary music, especially Christian contemporary, starting with the piano. As I grow more accustomed to this style, I eventually started make music of these sorts. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I've put some of my musical pieces on soundcloud. You'll find piano covers, original arrangements, and maybe even some singing as I play the guitar. To make things easier, you can find my songs on this website, where I can add more insight to my inspiration or thoughts to making or playing the song.  </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> It's a culture in America for Asian families to have thier children learn some classical instrument including Piano, Violin, and Trumpet. Well, I am no different. I started learn each of those instruments since 2nd grade. As I grew up, I added even more instruments to my list such as clarinet, drums, guitar, and Taiko (Japanese Drumming). </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> My highest musical growth period was during high school. During these 4 years, I did every band possible: Marching Band, Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, Pit Band, Jazz Band, Orchestra, and even once, a modern band (electric guitars, drumset, and singing). It was the life. Every day, I had some kind of musical obligation such that I got home around 5:00pm only to have to go back to practice at 7:00pm. My trumpet skills were amazing. During football games we played this song called 'Louie, Louie' where I played a trumpet solo that drove fear in to the other marching band's hearts. They joked sometimes and called the song 'Willy, Willy'. Here is the link to my performances: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7CcP0J_Hh8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7CcP0J_Hh8 </a> </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> I got many awards for trumpet. Amongst them was the Louie Armstrong award, given to the best jazz musician at the school.  </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> My last year in high school, I started to play Piano again and Guitar (I took a break from piano since elementary school) The reason? Well... People around me think I play instruments cause I generally like music. This is true! But, I picked up Piano again during my Senior year in high school because I wanted to impress a girl. Now, shush. (Find out more in one of my music songs. I'm not telling you which one.) </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> It didn't work out, but I continued learning music because I found it a very relaxing way to express myself and calm down. If I'm playing really hard on the Piano, I'm probably frustrated. </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> I continued playing piano and guitar throughout college, where I eventually picked up Taiko. I actually became the Taiko musical director for a few years. Here is the link to one of the performances: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8DHZkYJPVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8DHZkYJPVU </a> </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> I am on the far right playing the shime and okedo. </p>
        <img class="main-content-img" src='http://wallpapercave.com/wp/HkvZ9d2.jpg'>
        <p class="main-content-p"> After graduating, there weren't many places to play and perform. No bands to play the Trumpet. No Taiko groups to continue learning Taiko. But thankfully, there were plenty of opportunities at CEMC. At church, I continued to play the piano. I believe I will play the piano throughout the rest of my life. </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> I started making my own music during high school using 'Finale'. At the time, I was playing this MMORPG called Runescape. My first arrangement was transcribing the intro song for Runescape played at the log in screen. It didn't end up as I liked, but I continued to make my own songs from there. Unfortunately, I cannot retrieve my songs from high school anymore. It's lost somewhere in the school's student database.</p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> My last year in college, I decided to make an arrangement of the songs by Joe Hisaishi from films directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The songs included Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke. The medley was a success and performed at Mystique in TCNJ's Kendall Theater. </p>
        <p class="main-content-p"> Post-graduation, I decided to start learning how to make contemporary music. I learned how to use Audacity and FL Studio, and how to midi in to the DAW via piano keyboard. As you can imagine, having piano skills helped me immensely with producing music. After recording the midi, I learned to change the instruments given sound libraries. There are actually some pretty good free sound libraries out there, although it well never be as good as the real thing. My first composition using these set of tools is 'Hero's Sacrifice'. Here is the link: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/willian-hua/heros-sacrifice"> https://soundcloud.com/willian-hua/heros-sacrifice </a> </p>

        <p class="main-content-p"> My goals for music production are to create epic music from movies and christian contemporary music from Hillsong or Chris Tomlin. Of course, with my career path, I won't have a lot of time. Music production will be a hobby. One day, I may be able to create my own masterpiece. </p>
